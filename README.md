### [Five Myths of Testing by a Software QA](https://medium.com/cermati-tech/five-myths-of-testing-by-a-software-qa-27edb179fad)

## Thoughts:

This article explores the myth that surrounds the field of Software QA (Quality Assurance). Riry Juliani is an engineer at Cermati Tech who took on a role of a Software QA which she previously had no 
experience on. She tells us that being a tester is not as easy as one may think. Testing may seem easy because all you need to accomplish is find errors on code that is already written. She explains how 
it is a lot more to it and it involves many different complex steps that is not as obvious as it presents itself to be. 
>High analytical skills are required when you test a software for many possible use cases with minimum test cases.

Anyone with minimum knowledge can take on this role, but not everyone can do it effectively and efficiently. It takes a lot of practice and time to master the skill. Some think that the testing should 
just be left to the developers and there is no need to hire people just for that. Riry argues that developers often have a lot of others things to do so they will not be as committed to testing as 
people who are solely for that will be. This will create a bad, or not as good as it can be, software.

I find this article interesting because I was curious on how software testing is and it what people say about it true. Reading through this article from the perspective of someone in that field has 
enlighten me on the topic and made me respect it more. She took a chance on this new position because she had certain traits she thought was useful for it and I also think I share similar 
characteristics. So this may be something I will look into in the future.

## Response
@David -thanks for the writeup.  Like many other fields, QA has developed a wide array of specialized tools and techniques the breadth of which are difficult for a beginner to grasp.  With training and time, one will inevitably find that testers come of all stripes and sizes, from seasoned experts who can immediately develop comprehensive test plans, to test slackers who provide only the bare minimum necessary to get the boss off their back.  As a result, the reliability of software varies in proportion.
